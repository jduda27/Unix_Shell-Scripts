# Unix Shell Scripts
This repository contains all scripts that I've created either for assignments, 
inclass excersizes, or making my life easier.

Below are brief descriptions of a couple of the scripts.

### [browseScripts](https://github.com/jduda27/Unix_Shell-Scripts/blob/master/browseScripts)
This file was created in order to navigate my inclass scripts by week, from there
we look at all script files and read out what each program does before asking the user
to chose the script to open in vim to view or edit.

### [mkscr](https://github.com/jduda27/Unix_Shell-Scripts/blob/master/mkscr)
Because how we ran our files in class was by making the files executable, to save time
this script takes in a input for the name of the script and then it gives it executable
permission and then opens the new file in Vim with the first line #!/bin/bash already entered
in making it a bash file. If a file of the same name already exists in the location you are in 
it opens up the file in Vim.
